Github project link: https://github.com/FlagshipWP/genesis-sass/

This is a fork of the Genesis Sample Theme. It includes Sass and Grunt and will not necessairly be kept in sync with the original Genesis sample theme. We will make changes and improvements as we see fit.

=== Installation Instructions ===

1. Upload the Genesis Sass theme folder via FTP to your wp-content/themes/ directory. (The Genesis parent theme needs to be in the wp-content/themes/ directory as well.)
2. Go to your WordPress dashboard and select Appearance.
3. Activate the Genesis Sample theme.
4. Inside your WordPress dashboard, go to Genesis > Theme Settings and configure them to your liking.
